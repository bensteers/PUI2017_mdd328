Assignment 1 involved reading building and energy data to compare the number of building units against energy use. Descriptive statistics 
were at first used, with linear and parabolic regressions fitted after. The two models of linear and parabolic were compared to test
which better fits the data using a likelihood ratio test. I worked with Rebecca, Emily, Prince, and Sunglyoung, who helped me with 
graphing the fit line, and calculating errors and chi square. I contributed most during sections with the data munging, and 
preliminary graphs.
