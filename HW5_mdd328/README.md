Assignment 1 involved 100 samples of 1000 numbers in a poisson distribution. After finding the z statistic of each sample, the
distribution of z's was plotted, showing what is close to a normal distribution, and proven to be close to normal with a KS
test. I worked with Rebecca, Sarah, Emily, and Dana and helped create the for loop, while Prince helped me fit the resulting Z 
distribution into a normal distribution curve.

Assignment 2 involved formulating null hypotheses for the KS and AD tests and then interpreting their results. It then involved 
completing code that generated various test statistics (KD, AD, and Entropy) using varying amounts of samples. I worked with Rebecca,
Sarah, Emily, and Dana, helping look up how to interpret results from the various tests.

Assignment 3 involved reading in 4 datasets to investigate the relationships between country's number of firearms, homicides, 
mass shootings, and GDP. These correlations were tested and graphed with a number of models including OLS, WLS and polyfit. Matt Sauter
helped me with many of the models, while Charlie helped me change the color of the USA point in the graph. Dana and I worked together 
to figure out how to merge the data together.
