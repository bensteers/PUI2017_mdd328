PUI2017 HW 3 Matt Dwyer

The first assignment involved generating 100 different sized lists (between 10 and 2000) whose values were in a specific distribution, 
all with the same mean of 500. This was repeated 5 times for different distributions, with means generated from each list resulting in 
a list of 100 means and a corresponding list of the different sample sizes. Each list of means and sample sizes was then scatter 
plotted for each distribution, demonstrating the central limit theorem as the means approached 500, and the law of big numbers
as the higher the sample size the more likely the means would be closer to 500. I worked with Dana and Sounglyoung on this section,
helping understand what the question was asking and creating for loops. 

The second assignment involved formulating hypotheses and declaring a confidence level for citibike data. After choosing a month, I 
reduced the dataset down to the fields related to my question, which involves finding which times of day trip duration is the longest. 
A histrogram was then plotted to show the distribution of time durations, and then again with outliers eliminated for a better view.
I worked alone on this section. 

The third assignment tested a hypothesis that a new set of bus route times was significantly shorter than the older bus route times.
This involved importing the data, finding the mean, and using the old data's standard deviation and mean to calculate a Z-score.
The z-score was then interpreted with the proposed significance level, and as the z-score surpassed the significance level, the null
hypothesis was rejected. I worked with Dana, Rebecca, and Emily to help figure out how to interpret the calculated z-score and 
significance level.
