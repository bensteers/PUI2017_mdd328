# PUI2017_mdd328

I first used mkdir to create the PUI2017 directory in compute. 

To create the environmental variable, I used the text editor vi to make the variable PUI2017 be the path to the new directory. 

I then created an alias that would link to that directory using a cd command and the newly created variable.

The alias pui2017 now links to the PUI2017 directory.
