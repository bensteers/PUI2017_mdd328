# My Comments of Matthew Dwyer's (mdd328) Citibike Project_HW3_2
## 1. Null and alternative hypotheses 
#### a. The quantitative relation of $p_0$ and $p_1$ in terms of $H_0$ and $H_0$ is not described.
## 2. Data relavancy and quality of preparation
#### a. Histogram distribution figure1 does not make difference since the number of bins is just 1. There should be more bins to show distribution better.
## 3. Test selecting
#### The test is selected with reference to the online article (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116565/) .  According to figure 1 in the article, T- Test is chosen for this hypothesis testing.
