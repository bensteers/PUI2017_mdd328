Homework 4

Assignment 1 involved evaluating a classmate's setup for an experiment, with a loaded dateframe and null and alternative hypothesis. I worked alone for this assignment.

Assignment 2 involved creating the following table using scientific papers that utilized specific statistical tests. I worked alone for this assignment. 

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **| 
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
ANOVA	| 5, motor diagnostics | categorical | 1, adult performance level| continuous | 3, maturation characterists | continuous (could also be categorical) | Can motor diagnostics significantly predict the adult performance levels? | 5 motor tests > p | 0.001 | [The influence of speed abilities and technical skills in early adolescence on adult success in soccer: A long-term prospective analysis using ANOVA and SEM approaches](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182211) |
Correlation	| 1, fecal cortisol metabolites concentration | continuous | 1, parasitic richness| continuous | 1, random intercept for pack identity | continuous | What is the relationship between stress and parasitic infection? | r = 0 | 0.05 | [Environmental and Intrinsic Correlates of Stress in Free-Ranging Wolves](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137378) |
Logistic Regression	| 13, describing population, geographical area, and setting | categorical | 1, diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (present or absent)| dichotomous | Many including per capita GDP in US constant dollars, geographical area | continuous | What are the predictors of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in low and middle income countries? | Exp(B) = 0 | 0.05 | [Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in Tropical and Low and Middle Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Regression](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069969) |

  FBB good!

Assignment 3 recreated an analysis of the hard to employ program in New York using a chi square and z test. I worked with Sarah, Juan, and Julian on this assignment, helping figure out how to use the formulas.

Assignment 4 used the citibike data to test distributions of trip durations in either day or night and for ages in either Manhattan or Brooklyn. Kent helped me with the first half, showing me how to subset the data for the statistical tests, while I worked with Prince and  Sarah on the second half to figure out how to approximate Manhattan and Brooklyn using latitude and longitude. They also helped me interpret the test results and how they apply to the hypotheses.
