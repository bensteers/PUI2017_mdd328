Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

1. Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Hypothesis: 
    The average amount of body fat percentage is significantly lower for the sample group who have dieted than the group who have
    exercised. 
    H1: Pt > Pc
Null Hypothesis: 
    The average amount of body fat percentage is the same or higher for the sample group who have dieted than the group who have 
    exercised.
    H0: Pt <= Pc

2. Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Hypothesis: 
    The average IQ of the sample of children whose mothers smoked is significantly lower than the average IQ of children whose 
    mothers did not smoke, for each age group. 
Null Hypothesis: 
    The average IQ of the sample of children whose mothers smoked is the same or greater than the average IQ of children whose 
    mothers did not smoke, for each age group. 
            
3. Contribute to the incidence of diabetes 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found 
in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.
This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

Hypothesis:
    The distribution of diabetes correlates significantly with areas defined as food deserts.
Null Hypothesis:
    The distribution of diabetes does not correlate significantly with areas defined as food deserts.
